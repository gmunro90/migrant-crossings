<p class="lead">There is a long history of migration via the Mediterranean. Human mobility in all directions across the Mediterranean has occured for thousands of years.
  More recently, since at least the mid-1990s, thousands of people each year have crossed the Mediterranean by boat from the northern coasts of Africa and Turkey to seek asylum or to migrate
  to Europe if they do not have the documentation required by the countries of destination. It should be noted that the Mediterranean Sea is where irregular migration to Europe is most visible.

<p class="lead">Towards the end of 2015 and the first three months of 2016,
  Lesbos and other Greek islands were the main entry point for over
  900,000 refugees who reached Europe at that time.</p>

  <p class="lead">After the agreement between the European Union and Turkey
    in March 2016, the refugees who reached the Aegean Islands
     would be deported to Turkey and, consequently, 
     the entrance point to Europe from there was closed.</p>
  
  <p class="lead">Thus, existing routes that are longer and more dangerous
     in the Central Mediterranean were intensified. This journey is much
    longer, approximately 300 km to the island of Lampedusa and over 500 km to Sicily,
      therefore the number of deaths in this critical area is consistently growing.</p>
