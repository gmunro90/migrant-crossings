      <p class="lead">There is a long history of migration via the Mediterranean. Human mobility in all directions across the Mediterranean has occured for thousands of years.
        More recently, since at least the mid-1990s, thousands of people each year have crossed the Mediterranean by boat from the northern coasts of Africa and Turkey to seek asylum or to migrate
        to Europe if they do not have the documentation required by the countries of destination. It should be noted that the Mediterranean Sea is where irregular migration to Europe is most visible.

      <p class="lead">Towards the end of 2015 and the first three months of 2016,
        Lesbos and other Greek islands were the main entry point for over
        900,000 refugees who reached Europe at that time.</p>
      
        <p class="lead">After the agreement between the European Union and Turkey
          in March 2016, the refugees who reached the Aegean Islands
           would be deported to Turkey and, consequently, 
           the entrance point to Europe from there was closed.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">Thus, existing routes that are longer and more dangerous
           in the Central Mediterranean were intensified. This journey is much
          longer, approximately 300 km to the island of Lampedusa and over 500 km to Sicily,
            therefore the number of deaths in this critical area is consistently growing.</p>

      <h1 class="who">Who are we?</h1>
      
      <p>We are Open Arms
        We are a non-profit non-governmental organisation with one principal mission: to protect those who try to reach Europe by sea, fleeing from armed conflict, persecution or poverty; and also to inform and educate on land so that those who migrate can make decisions with complete freedom and knowledge.
        
        Our intention is to monitor and rescue vessels carrying people who need help in the Mediterranean channel, to protect the lives of the most vulnerable in emergency situations on land and to build alternatives to irregular migration in countries such as Senegal, providing people with resources through community awareness and information. In parallel, we continue to denounce all of the injustices that take place that nobody talks about.
        
        It all started with some photographs of drowned children on a beach. We thought: if our job is maritime rescue and we do it on our beaches, why are they dying over there without anybody to help them?</p>

    <img class="who-img" src="https://www.openarms.es/uploads/quienes_somos/qs_photo_1.jpg?1525421802596">

    <h2>With your help, we continue to save lives</h2>
    <p>With the help of many people to collaborate with their donations, we have been able to increase our resources and save more lives every day: both at sea and on land.

      Also, thanks to their support, we can carry out educational work in schools that seek to generate empathy and critical thought among the youngest generation in order to create a society that is critical of inequality and that fights for a world that is more fair and just.</p>
